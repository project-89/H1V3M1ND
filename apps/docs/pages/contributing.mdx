## Code Standards

### TypeScript Guidelines
```typescript
// Use explicit types
interface MissionProps {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  reward: number;
}

// Use functional components
export function MissionCard({ 
  id, 
  title, 
  reward 
}: MissionProps) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>{title}</h2>
      <p>Reward: {reward} Project89</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Testing Requirements
